After addressing data cleaning and class imbalance, Random Forest remains the best model for predicting taxi cancellations, but for different reasons than before. Initially, Random Forest had the highest accuracy (90.3%) but a poor recall for cancellations (12%), meaning it mostly predicted non-cancellations. After balancing the dataset with SMOTE, its accuracy slightly decreased to 84.0%, but its recall for cancellations improved significantly (84%), making it much better at detecting actual cancellations. Compared to the Neural Network, which initially had the highest accuracy (92.9%) but completely failed at predicting cancellations (0% recall).
